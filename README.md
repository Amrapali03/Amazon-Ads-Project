# Amazon-Ads-Project-SU

In our analysis of advertising campaigns, we focused on optimizing the new-to-brand segment by leveraging exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques. Using Tableau and Python, we identified key features influencing cost and impressions, including placement slots, targeting categories, months, and days of the week. We aimed to propose an optimal bidding strategy to targeted advertisers, focusing on maximizing viewable impressions and reach. By identifying the most significant factors, we aimed to reduce missed opportunities and pinpoint areas for improvement and growth within the campaign strategy.
